# flores_coppock_2018/download_original.R
# Output: original/ (the deposited replication archive, not redistributed in this repo)
# Depends on: original_manifest.csv
# Description: Fetch the deposited archive from Harvard Dataverse and verify every file.
#   Run this once before running anything in maintained/. Re-running is free: files
#   already present with the right checksum are not downloaded again.
#
#   The manifest carries two checksums per file. md5_served is the MD5 of the bytes
#   Dataverse returns for `?format=original`, which is what this code was written
#   against. md5_published is the checksum Dataverse displays. Here all 14 agree, but
#   they do not always: other deposits carry published checksums that verify neither
#   the deposited file nor the tabular one derived from it, so verification runs
#   against md5_served and any disagreement is reported rather than hidden by a check
#   failing for the wrong reason.
#
#   Every file in this deposit sits under a `replication_archive` directory label, so
#   the manifest paths carry that prefix and the local copy mirrors it.
#
#   Three of the 14 files were ingested by Dataverse into tabular .tab representations;
#   the served_as column records the name Dataverse gives the derived file.
#   `?format=original` returns the deposited .csv bytes in every case.

# has lost two that it does. Nothing in maintained/ writes here, and this check stops
# the run if anything ever does.
# all.files = TRUE is not optional: without it a stray dotfile passes unseen, and a
# deposit can ship dotfiles of its own, which the manifest then has to list.
